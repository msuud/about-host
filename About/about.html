            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              In 2023, Oasis Bliss Resort came into being, <br />born from a
              vision that transcends the ordinary. <br />Our founders, driven by
              a deep appreciation for the serene beauty <br />
              of nature, envisioned a place where <br />people could escape from
              the relentless pace of daily life <br />and immerse themselves in
              a world of tranquility.
